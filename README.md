Task 1: Create an "if" statement  10 marks
●	Declare a variable and assign it a numeric value.
●	Write an "if" statement that checks if the value is greater than 10.
●	If the condition is true, log a message to the console.
Task 2: Use "if-else" statements  10 marks
●	Declare a variable and assign it a numeric value.
●	Write an "if-else" statement that checks if the value is even.
●	If the condition is true, log a message stating that the number is even; otherwise, log a message stating that the number is odd.
Task 3: Use "if-else if-else" statements  10 marks
●	Declare a variable and assign it a numeric value.
●	Write an "if-else if-else" statement to check the range of the value.
●	If the value is less than 0, log a message stating that it is negative.
●	If the value is greater than 0, log a message stating that it is positive.
●	If neither condition is met, log a message stating that it is zero.
Task 4: Nest "if" statements  10 marks
●	Declare two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them numeric values.
●	Write an outer "if" statement to check if num1 is greater than 0.
●	Inside the "if" block, write an inner "if" statement to check if num2 is greater than 0.
●	If both conditions are true, log a message stating that both numbers are positive.
Task 5: Use the ternary operator  10 marks
●	Declare a variable and assign it a numeric value.
●	Use the ternary operator to check if the value is greater than 10.
●	If the condition is true, log a message stating that it is greater than 10; 2otherwise, log a message stating that it is less than or equal to 10.
Task 6: Compare multiple conditions with logical operators  30 marks
●	Declare a variable and assign it a numeric value.
●	Write a compound condition using logical operators to check if the value is between 5 and 10 (inclusive).
●	If the condition is true, log a message stating that the value is in the specified range; otherwise, log a message stating that it is outside the range.
Task 7: Use the "switch" statement  20 marks
●	Declare a variable and assign it a string value representing a day of the week.
●	Write a "switch" statement to perform different actions based on the day.
●	Log a message with a specific action for each day (e.g., "Monday: Start of the week").
